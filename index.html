                    My goal is to get a well-paid job with interesting career opportunities in the information technology industry. This sphere attracts me for its high speed growth and how it’s changing the world making it digital. For achieving my goal, I have set certain priorities for myself. The most important thing is a constant self-education, because in the field of information technology you constantly have to adapt to new conditions in order to do your job. It is also an important priority to take care of your physical state and keep it in a good condition, because the performance of the brain and the ability to absorb new information in a short period of time strongly depends on this feature.
                    My strength is in rapid learning of foreign languages: besides English, I speak German and Chinese a little. Learning languages is my hobby. I work as a journalist, prepare content for websites also do some copyright and a little of texts SEO-optimization. I have a certain experience in creating of advertising content.

You can say: “It was ten years ago” and you will be both right and wrong. I was practicing quite often during these years after the graduation while was writing content for mass media. So my level is about c1-c2 I suppose.</div>
